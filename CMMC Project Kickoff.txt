### 7. CRITICAL PATH & RISK MITIGATION

**Critical Path Items** (Cannot be delayed):
1. **Days 1-7**: System inventory and CUI identification
   - Risk: Incomplete inventory means missed controls
   - Mitigation: Use automated discovery tools

2. **Days 8-16**: Technical assessments and STIG validation
   - Risk: Systems not hardened, require significant remediation
   - Mitigation: Run initial SCAP scans immediately, prioritize critical gaps

3. **Days 15-20**: Interview completion
   - Risk: Key personnel unavailable
   - Mitigation: Schedule interviews in advance, record for transcription

4. **Days 21-28**: SSP and POA&M development
   - Risk: Documentation bottleneck
   - Mitigation: Start SSP template immediately, update iteratively

5. **Days 29-33**: CISO review and approval
   - Risk: CISO requires significant changes
   - Mitigation: Weekly CISO briefings, no surprises at end

**Go/No-Go Decision Points**:

**Day 10 Check**: Are we on track?
- 30% of controls assessed
- All interviews scheduled
- No critical gaps that require >30 days to remediate

**Day 20 Check**: Can we meet deadline?
- 70% of controls assessed
- SSP at 50% complete
- POA&M items have remediation plans

**Day 28 Check**: Ready for final review?
- 100% of controls assessed
- All documentation complete
- Evidence artifacts organized
